# RTL-SDR Signal Monitor & Playback Viewer

**A Windows-based RTL-SDR tool for detecting, capturing, and reviewing RF signals.**

## Overview
This application continuously **monitors a center frequency**, detecting signals that exceed **15 dB above the noise floor**. When a signal is detected, the system **captures up to 60 seconds of IQ data** and saves it in a **compressed archive (ZIP format)**‚Äîensuring a minimum delay between captures, as configured by the user.

The **Playback Viewer** allows users to:
- **Review captured signals** via waveform and waterfall visualizations.
- **Scrub through recorded IQ data** with a seek bar.
- **Export recordings to SDRSharp-compatible WAV format** for further analysis.

## Key Features
üì° **Real-Time Signal Detection** ‚Äì Automatically records signals that exceed a configurable threshold.  
üíæ **Compressed IQ Data Storage** ‚Äì Saves signal captures efficiently in a ZIP archive.  
üìä **Playback & Visualization** ‚Äì Displays waveform and waterfall plots of recorded signals.  
‚è™ **Seekable Playback** ‚Äì Scrub through recordings with a timeline control.  
üéõ **WAV Export for SDRSharp** ‚Äì Convert recorded IQ data into a Baseband WAV file for external analysis.  

## Use Case
Ideal for **radio enthusiasts, spectrum monitoring, and signal intelligence (SIGINT) applications**, this tool enables efficient detection, recording, and review of intermittent RF signals.

# Getting Started with SigInt  

Don't have an RTL-SDR and want to get started? This guide will walk you through setting up an **RTL-SDR** device and configuring **SigInt** to begin capturing signals.

## 1. Get an RTL-SDR Device  
You'll need a **USB RTL-SDR receiver**. The **RTL-SDR Blog V3** is recommended and widely supported. Other RTL-SDR dongles may also work, but have not been tested with SigInt.
### **Connect an Antenna**
After plugging in your RTL-SDR, attach an **antenna** for best reception.  
For example, for signals near **1.6 GHz**, the ideal antenna length depends on the type:

- **Half-wave dipole:** **3.5-inch elements per side** (best for standalone dipole use).  
- **Quarter-wave monopole:** **1.75-1.8-inch elements** (requires a ground plane).  

A common, inexpensive and effective choice is a **dipole antenna with 3.5-inch arms**, as shown below:

(Adjustable dipole kits work well if you need to experiment with different lengths.)

## 2. Install RTL-SDR Drivers  
Before using your device, follow the official **RTL-SDR Blog‚Äôs Getting Started Guide**:  
üëâ [RTL-SDR Blog ‚Äì Start Here](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-quick-start-guide/)  

This will walk you through:
- Installing **Zadig** to replace the default Windows driver.
- Verifying that the device is detected properly.

## 3. Install SDR# (SDRSharp)  
To confirm your RTL-SDR is working, install **SDR#** (pronounced "S-D-R Sharp," a basic software-defined radio tool and is free for personal and non-commercial use):  
üëâ [Download SDR#](https://airspy.com/download/)  

1. Chosoe the **"Software Defined Radio Package"** package link on the right side.  
2. Run the **install-rtlsdr.bat** script inside the folder.  
3. Open **SDRSharp.exe**, select **RTL-SDR (USB)** as the source, and press **Start**.  
4. Tune to a known local FM station (~88-108 MHz) via the big numbers at the top of the window to confirm reception.  

If you hear audio and see a signal, your RTL-SDR is working.

## 4. Install and Configure SigInt  
Once your RTL-SDR is working, download and install **SigInt** from the repository: (https://github.com/RichardLWolf/SigInt/releases/latest).

1. **Plug in your RTL-SDR device** before launching SigInt.  
2. **Set your desired frequency** (e.g., **1.6 GHz**).  
3. Press **Start** to begin signal monitoring.  

SigInt will:
- Display the signal spectrum and begin monitoring.  
- Minimize it and let it run.  SigInt will detect and log signal events automatically.  

For more details, always check the included documentation.
